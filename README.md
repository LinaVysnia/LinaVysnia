# Welcome to Lina's GitHub!

Hi, it's nice to have you here. I'm _branching out_ and web development is my **new twig**. 
![GitHub branching](https://wac-cdn-a.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:389059a7-214c-46a3-bc52-7781b4730301/hero.svg?cdnVersion=ey)

## Projects
Oh yes, the most exciting part. I'm currently learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, the basics of computer science and **version control**. If you're into that, you're in the right place, here are some projects I've done so far.

### [The Periodic Table of Elements](https://github.com/LinaVysnia/Periodic-table.git) 
Do you feel like checking in on the elements? Expect to experience responsive design and some cool gradients!
Do you have any input to share? For example, how using JavaSript could make this page more efficient? I'm all ears!

### [Fortune Teller](https://github.com/LinaVysnia/Fortune-Teller.git)
Do you want to know when you'll meet your best friend? Or at what time in your life you'll go through such turmoil that will make you dye your hair? Look no further than the console log when running this page!
Do you have any suggestions? Maybe something like how the fortune could be displayed in a pop-up message? I'm welcoming all the tips!

### [Water Bill Calculator](https://github.com/LinaVysnia/Water-Bill-Calculator.git)
Do you ever wonder how much you'd pay for a water bill if you lived in Cape Town in 2019? You're in luck! I've built a custom calculator **exactly** for this situation.
Did this make you ponder? Maybe you want to suggest how to make the results more easily accessible for an average Joe without a debug console? I would be incredibly happy to see how you would approach this!

I feel incredibly grateful to my mentors Kaya Gupta and Anita Dreosti for all the work empowering women. Also, for inspiring the strength and courage in me to learn programming.
