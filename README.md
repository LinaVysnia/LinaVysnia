# Welcome to Lina's GitHub!

Hi, it's nice to have you here. I'm _branching out_ and Python development is my **new twig**. 
Having studied JavaScript, HTML, CSS, the basics of computer science, fetching data, node.js, react.js I'm gazing into the dreamy horizons of _Machine Learning_. Python is the new black, let's not forget SQL, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and some actual **version control** this time. If you're into that, you're in the right place.

## Projects
Oh yes, the most exciting part. Here are some projects I've done so far.

### [Weather small talk tips for London](https://github.com/LinaVysnia/Small-talk-weather-tips.git)
Are you in London and somebody is trying to start small talk with you? Don't fret, talk about the weather! Here's a page with a live list of handy information about the local meteorological conditions.
Do you have any tips on how to keep the data updated every time the live data updates? Do start this small talk and tell me your ideas!

### [The Periodic Table of Elements](https://github.com/LinaVysnia/Periodic-table.git) 
Do you feel like checking in on the elements? Expect to experience responsive design and some cool gradients!
Do you have any input to share? For example, how using JavaSript could make this page more efficient? I'm all ears!

### [Fortune Teller](https://github.com/LinaVysnia/Fortune-Teller.git)
Do you want to know when you'll meet your best friend? Or at what time in your life you'll go through such turmoil that will make you dye your hair? Look no further than the console log when running this page!
Do you have any suggestions? Maybe something like how the fortune could be displayed in a pop-up message? I'm welcoming all the tips!
